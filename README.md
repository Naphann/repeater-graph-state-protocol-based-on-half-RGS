# Repeater Graph State Protocols based on Half-RGS Building Block

This repository contains the simulation code to verify the RGS protocol proposed in the paper [Architecure and Protocols for All-photonic Quantum Repeaters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03748).

A simple implementation using [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim) is outlined in the [notebook file](RGS-protocol-simulation.ipynb).
