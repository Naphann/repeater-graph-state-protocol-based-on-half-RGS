    "# Repeater Graph State Bell pair distribution protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "[The protocol implemented in this paper is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03748]\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the two-stage protocol for all-photonic quantum repeater based on repeater graph state (RGS) originally proposed by [Azuma et al., [NatComm. 2015, 6:6787]](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7787).\n",
    "Each step of the protocol is implemented in its own function where all the steps are annotated in `experiment_setup()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the protocol, we check the final stabilizer generators of the quantum state.\n",
    "The protocol is correct if the states shared between two ends (alice and bob) are described with stabilizer Z_alice X_bob and Z_bob X_alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no simulation of classical communication between nodes but when a step requires classical communication, the information will be stored and processed with other information in a different step. This is to ensure that we cannot cheat by having extra information and to agree with our proposed protocol."
